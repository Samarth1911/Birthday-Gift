            <p>Hey there,
                Its been a long time talking to each other directly. Yes I have been wrong a
                quite many times and it became the primarily main reason for us not talking.
                Its obvious of you getting angry one me cause I accept I have been an idiot,
                so I am creating this, on your birthday as an apology and also as the small 
                birthday gift from me. 
            </p>
