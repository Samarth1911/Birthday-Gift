            Story after the 10th boards
            </h1>
            <p>10th was finally over and everyone was happy as papers went well. Farewell was organised
                but you didn't came cause of some reasons. On the next day, I didnt know what was going into 
                my mind, whether it was fear of not seeing you again cause back till then, you didnt told me
                where you were going to take admissions, or whether it was the feeling of not able to convey
                my feelings again. I conveyed my feeling to you and may be ruining our developing
                friendship. Was that a blunder? Yes. Was that something which I shouldn't have done? Yes 
                Am I guilty about it? To be more precise, a little because I didnt care at that time how would
                you feel about that thing. 
            </p>
            <p>After this blunder, conversations between us became more awkward. You were thinking twice
                and I was thinking four times putting a message and initiating a conversation. We later ended
                up fighting and you blocking me ðŸ˜¶.
