            This is the story of standard 7th
            </h1>
            <p>You were in the class and the new tall guy has jut admitted into the class. 
                An extrovert, an ambious guy came from 400 km away from your native town into your class. We both
                become the monitor and I still remember how you used to be always pissed of with
                me cause of me roaming in the class ðŸ˜‚. 
            </p>
            <p>Not the kind of normal interaction but it was funny for me getting scolded by you. We 
                both didn't knew back then where would this story go and end.
